Password manager (v2)


## Steps for device flow auth
1. app requests device and user codes **done**
2. app prompts user to enter code through browser
3. app sends post request to endpoint, gets token



## TODO
- right after step one is completed, store device code in shared preferences, display user code and open browser
- build section to access password list (finish settings page first)
