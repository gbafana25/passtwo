## Steps for device flow auth **done**
1. app requests device and user codes 
2. app prompts user to enter code through browser
3. app sends post request to endpoint, gets token



## TODO
- **started** build section to access password list (finish settings page first)
	- when account is selected from dialog, print file (as byte array)
- add separate button to refresh/download data
